This is GDB, a source-level debugger intended for GNU,
presently running under un*x.

Before compiling GDB, you must set up links to five files according to
the kind of machine you are running on.  To do this, type `config.gdb
machine', where machine is something like `vax' or `sun2'.  This
creates links named `param.h', `opcode.h', `pinsn.c', and `infdep.c'.

Once these files are set up, just `make' will do everything,
producing an executable `gdb' in this directory.

About the machine-dependent files...

m-<machine>.h

This file contains macro definitions that express information
about the machine's registers, stack frame format and instructions.

<machine>-opcode.h, <machine>-pinsn.c
These files contain the information necessary to print instructions
for your cpu type.

<machine>-dep.c
Those routines which provide a low level interface to ptrace and which
tend to be machine-dependent.  (The machine-independent routines are in
`infrun.c' and `inflow.c')

About debugging gdb with itself . . .

You probably want to do a "make TAGS" after you configure your
distribution; this will put the machine dependent routines for your
local machine where they will be accessed first by a M-period .

Also, you want to make sure that gdb is not compiled with shared
libraries on the Sun 4.  And you want to make sure that you've
compiled gdb with your local cc or taken appropriate precautions
regarding ansification of include files.  See the Makefile for more
information. 

The "info" command, when executed without a subcommand in a gdb being
debugged by gdb, will pop you back up to the top level gdb.  See
.gdbinit for more details.
